# RobotVsDino2

Revisiting Robot vs Dino, and going to redesign and make it into a much better CommandLine game.
I want it to be much bigger scope taking advantage of TDD, interfaces, inheritance and with responsive GUI.

Gameplay flow will be updated, and focus will be on making it a game where two players can play
at the same time with the game hiding some player inputs.
I want it to be kind of like a turn based fighting game with attack speed with a lot of actions.

Going to experiment with what I would like to call staggered Action Reaction turn passing
that I would like to explore and experiment with for potentially future digital card games.

Main Objectives:
1. Keep the code clean and serve as a good portfolio project to show off my skills.
2. Have an engaging game that is responsive and fun.
3. Really experiment with the staggered Action Reaction turn passing system.
Going to use it for this rather than my own game first.
